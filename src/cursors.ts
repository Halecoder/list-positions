 * A cursor in a collaborative list or text string.

 * A Cursor points to a particular spot in a list, in between
 * two list elements (or text characters).
 * You can use Cursors as ordinary cursors or selection endpoints.
 *
 * Use the [[Cursors]] class to convert between indices and Cursors.
 *
 * Internally, a cursor is represented as a string.
 * Specifically, it is the [[Position]] of the list element
 * to its left, or "START" if it is at the beginning
 * of the list. If that position is later deleted, the cursor stays the
 * same, but its index shifts to the next element on its left.
